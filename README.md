**Dataset:** [Kaggle Dataset 📊](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos)

## Introduction 📚:
This project aims to predict the number of calories burnt during physical activity using personal and physiological features. The dataset includes user information such as age, gender, height, weight, duration of exercise, heart rate, and body temperature.

The project involves:

1. Data exploration and cleaning 🧹.
2. Feature engineering 🛠️.
3. Data visualization and insights 📈.
4. Building and evaluating a predictive model using XGBoost 💻.
5. Analyzing results and summarizing findings 🧠.

## Project Steps 📝

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration 📂
- Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn.
- Load the dataset and check for missing values ❓ and basic statistics 📊.

### 2. Data Visualization 📉
- Create visualizations to explore the distribution of the target variable (Calories burnt) 🔥.
- Investigate the relationship between features such as Duration ⏱️, Heart Rate 💓, and Calories.

### 3. Feature Engineering 🧬
- Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) as a new feature 🏃‍♀️.
- Use one-hot encoding for categorical features (Gender) 👩‍🦱👨‍🦱.
- Explore correlations between features 🔍.

### 4. Model Building 🧑‍💻
- Split the data into training and testing sets ⚙️.
- Use XGBoost Regressor to train the model on the training data 🚀.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score 📊.

### 5. Model Evaluation 📈
- Evaluate model performance on the test set 🔬.
- Analyze feature importance 🔑 and residuals 🧐.

### 6. Results and Conclusion 🏆
- The XGBoost model achieves high accuracy ✅, explaining a large portion of the variance in the calories burnt prediction.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy 📊
- Matplotlib, Seaborn 📈
- XGBoost 🔥
- Scikit-learn ⚙️

## Conclusion 🎯
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict calories burnt during physical activity. The model provides useful insights into the factors influencing calorie burn, including exercise duration ⏱️ and heart rate 💓.
